<p><strong>Bigger Reactors</strong> is the official continuation of the original <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/big-reactors">Big Reactors</a> mod, by Erogenous Beef. It can be used to create highly-customizable reactors that can generate large amounts of power, while still being fun to work with.</p>
<p>From the CurseForge page:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You want power? We got power. <strong>Bigger Reactors</strong> is an energy generation mod based on the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/big-reactors">original by Erogenous Beef</a>. Semi-inspired by real reactor designs, this mod allows for mix-n-match reactors to generate lots of power. Each block you place can change the overall performance of a reactor.</p>
  <p>• Higher fuel efficiency? Yep.</p>
  <p>• More power? Uh-huh.</p>
  <p>• A giant reactor just to flex on your friends? Sure.</p>
  <p>All you need to get started is some reactor casing, a power tap, access port, fuel &amp; control rods, and terminal. Then just pipe/hopper in some Yellorium or Blutonium, flip the switch, and you're off!</p>
  <p>Need more power? Just build some <strong>Bigger Reactors</strong>.</p>
